During my attempt to build my first Ruby on Rails app, I've discovered just how painfully ignorant I am about how the MVC architecture works. At first glance (and after finishing <a title="Rails for Zombies" href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a>), I felt I had a solid understanding. I suppose I'm used to the way simple HTML or PHP files function and this layer of complexity that comes with MVC melts my brain.

How I thought I understood it:

-   Model = Database
-   View = HTML (not a perfect analogy, of course, but similar in that it only displays things)
-   Controller = business logic!

Since I'm familiar with PHP, I decided I would try to see how <a title="Zend" href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a> works, since it too uses the MVC architecture. I quickly realized my proto-app was nearly identical to the way my first RoR app looked. So Zend wasn't the best option for me to try to understand this.

And so I began Googling and ran across some great reading material (links @ the bottom of this post) that helped me to further shape my understanding.

How I now understand it:
<ul>
  <li>Model = Middleman between the database and the app and the location of business logic (not the controller, as I had thought)</li>
  <li>View = HTML (I think I was actually right!)</li>
  <li>Controller = The "glue" between Models and Views, and the traffic controller (no business logic here!)</li>
</ul>
<div>Now if I could only figure out why I can't get this thing to talk to my local MySQL database...</div>
