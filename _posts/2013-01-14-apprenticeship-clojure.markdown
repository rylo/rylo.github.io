Last week was my first full week as a resident apprentice at 8th Light, and boy was it productive.

I managed to grind my way through the <a href="http://clojurekoans.herokuapp.com/">Clojure Koans</a>, learn how to use <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>/<a href="http://speclj.com/">Speclj</a> and built my first Clojure application--<a href="https://github.com/rylo/t3-clojure">a simple implementation of tic tac toe</a>.

By far the most challenging part of last week was finding the right documentation for whatever I was working on. After asking around and doing quite a bit of digging through other blogs and the web, I managed to accumulate a list of useful resources for Clojure beginners. Enjoy!

<strong>Helpful Docs for Clojure Beginners</strong>
<ul>
  <li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">Clojure Cheat Sheet</a> - Wonderful at-a-glance cheat-sheet for Clojure. I always had this page open in a tab!</span></li>
  <li><a href="http://clojure.github.com/clojure/api-index.html">Clojure API Index</a> - Lists all Clojure functions in one spot, alphabetically. I found this less useful than the cheat sheet, as it doesn't separate functions meaningfully.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blackstag.com/blog.posting?id=5">The Blackstag Blog: Guide to Programming in Clojure for Beginners</a> - Great intro read and tutorial for those completely new to Clojure.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.lisperati.com/clojure-spels/casting.html">Casting SPELs with Clojure</a> - This was an <em>ENORMOUS</em> help for me in the first few days of learning Clojure. The illustrations are fun and made it easier for me to initially wrap my head around some concepts.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/32243344470/mocking-input-in-clojure-thanks-colin">Mocking Input in Clojure</a> - Mike Ebert, a fellow apprentice, wrote an awesome article about mocking input (specifically re-binding functions using <code>with-redefs</code> and <code>with-in-str)</code> and made testing much, much easier.</li>
</ul>
