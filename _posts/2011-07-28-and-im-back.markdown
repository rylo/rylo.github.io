So we've come a long way in a (relatively) short time! Things I've learned about over the past 6 months:

<ol>
  <li>Ubuntu/Debian</li>
  <li>GlassFish Server</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>FileMaker Pro</li>
</ol>

So where does that put me now? A few months back, I began pairing with someone I know here in Chicago and loved it, but didn't have the time to commit to really learn Ruby. I've had a change of heart recently and came back to picking up Ruby on Rails–this time for realzies.

I started by starting <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> again (for those that don't know, it's a test-driven, guided introduction to the Ruby language) and by completing <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> (an excellent place to hop into rails if you've gotten your feet wet with Ruby).

Now to just start on my first RoR project...
