So we've come a long way in a (relatively) short time! Things I've learned about over the past 6 months:
<ol>
  <li>Ubuntu/Debian - cake. (okay I still have to look stuff up, but who doesn't)</li>
  <li>GlassFish - I can get it running and keep it that way. Guess that's enough, right?</li>
  <li>MySQL - Easy peasy! Granted I'm no SQL wizard, I do know my way around well enough to be dangerous</li>
  <li>PHP - Best thing to happen to me in terms of data porting. Built a couple of custom blogs from scratch and enjoyed it, but felt it was too wonky for larger projects.</li>
  <li>FileMaker Pro - Okay so I've been developing for this for a long time, but I've found there are always more things to learn. Porting between MySQL and FMP has been a learning experience and I now know more about a relational database than I care to admit.</li>
</ol>
So where does that put me now? A few months back, I began paired programming with someone I know here in Chicago and loved it, but didn't have the time to commit to really learn Ruby. I've had a change of heart recently and came back to picking up Ruby on Rails–this time for realzies.

I started by starting <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> again (for those that don't know, it's a test-driven, guided introduction to the Ruby language) and by completing <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> (an excellent place to hop into rails if you've gotten your feet wet with Ruby).

Now to just start on my first RoR project...
